    Minimum dimension for upload: 2048 x 1152 px.
    Minimum safe area for text and logos: 1546 x 423 px. Larger images may get cropped on certain views or devices.
    Maximum width: 2560 x 423 px. This means that the "safe area" is always visible regardless of screen size. The areas to each side of the channel art are visible or cropped depending on browser size.
