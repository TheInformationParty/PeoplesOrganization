Hello, This is a simple guide that has been developed while building the position of Community Manager for The Information Party.
For now it will just be a simple list of things that have to be handled before realy digging into being active in the position.

What is the role and responsibilites of the Community Manager
- As of writing this document the community manager is head of the project in full. This may change in the future but for
now we can think of this position as CEO of the project.
- The first and formost goal of this position is to keep the wheels greased for each piece of the project and orcastrate
 simple and proper communication to all who are involved. This indludes setting up and managing all communication channels
 along with migrating individuals and groups to the proper location to have the conversations needed for each piece of the project.
- The second and equally important goal of this position is to set groups up with specific goals and time frames that are
 reasonable and obtainable by those tasked. This should also include assisting in making sure the resources needed are available
 and positivly reinforcing progress and completion.
